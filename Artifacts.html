<h1>My Visual Design Artifacts</h1>
<h2>Artifact #1</h2>
	
		<img src="pixil-frame-0.png" width="100" height="100" alt=""/>
	<br>
		<p>This was my emoji pixel drawing of an emoji sighing (not smoking, don't smoke kids). I made this on my own</p>
	<h2>Artifact #2</h2>
<img src="kayflock.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
	<br>
	<p>This was an album type self-made design of kay flock that I did. Pretty simple, nothing much to say about it ;-; Surprisingly, it took some time.</p>
	<h2>Artifact #3</h2>
	<img src="d.a.png" width="200" height="300" alt=""/>
	<p>This was a filter-change of Puerto Rican food I found on the internet. I love pernil and platano maduro. Everything on those plates are muah. (yum :D)</p>
	<h2>Artifact #4</h2>
<img src="grayscale.png" width="789" height="443" alt=""/>
	<p>This is a grayscale portrait of me and fray, any darker tones is more on the darker side, any lighter tones is gray-white. (I look better in this, it took long) :O</p>
	<h2>Artifact #5</h2>
<img src="battle.png" width="600" height="600" alt=""/>
	<p>This is a beast battle of animals mixed with one another on the beach, amazing ikr. One on the left is a Jaguar mixed with Swan wings and a fox head, and the one on the right is a whale mixed with owl wings and panda ears on the beach fighting.</p>
	<h2>Artifact #6</h2>
<img src="da.mandalas1.png" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
	<p>This is a mandala using the spotify logo, with color changes and shadow. (It looks weird) </p>
